(* In the F# 3.1 release and earlier versions, the compiler's overload resolution
   breaks on the following class definition. The referenced assembly defines
   several classes with various overloaded methods and constructors; some of these
   overloads include parameters whose type is a "high-rank" array -- that is,
   an array of rank 5-32. Arrays with these ranks are not currently supported by
   F#, but it should still be possible to call one of the overloads which does
   not include such a parameter. *)
