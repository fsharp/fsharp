### First, check if this is the right repository

The https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp repository is for cross platform packaging only.
The development of compiler and core library it's in the [Microsoft/visualfsharp][Microsoft/visualfsharp] repository

* **Do you think it's specific to Mono or OSX/Linux?** That's the right repository

* **It's about Windows or Visual Studio?** You should go to the [Microsoft/visualfsharp][Microsoft/visualfsharp] repository

* **It's a general bug/feature in compiler/core library?** You should go to the [Microsoft/visualfsharp][Microsoft/visualfsharp] repository

* **Not sure?** You should go to the [Microsoft/visualfsharp][Microsoft/visualfsharp] repository

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/issues) and in the [Microsoft/visualfsharp Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [contributing guide][fsharp-contributing-guide].

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* It's about about the future evolution of the F# Language or Core Library? Suggest your change in the [F# Language Design User Voice site](https://fslang.uservoice.com/forums/245727-f-language).
  After a feature/change is "approved-in-principle", it's discussed in the [F# language design repository](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues)
  and implemented as Github pull request in the [Microsoft/visualfsharp][Microsoft/visualfsharp] repository
  
* Otherwise, open a Github pull request

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use F# in the [F# mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/fsharp-opensource)
