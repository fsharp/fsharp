This is the F# compiler and core library for Mono, based on the F# Powerpack code drop
under the OSS approved Apache 2.0 license.

The build follows the cli\2.0 and cli\4.0 configuration on the original *.fsproj files included in
the F# Powerpack code drop, in terms of flags and defines.

To bootstrap the compiler, binaries built on VS2010 are used, as the official binaries
fail to build due to a possible tail call bug on Mono.

This build is based on F# Powerpack r54075

======= REQUIREMENTS =======

Requires mono 2.8.
Requires bootstrapping libraries, tools and f# compiler. The lib/bootstrap/X.0 directories contain
mono-built libraries, compiler and tools that can be used to bootstrap a build. You can also supply
your own via the --with-bootstrap option.

======= BUILDING =======

To build, run autoreconf to generate a configure script, then run configure and make in
the usual way.
